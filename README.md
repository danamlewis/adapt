The first step is cloning the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jessiepusateri/adapt.git
```

You need the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager to build the project. Once you
have it installed,

```
$ cd adapt
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

These steps will fetch the dependencies for you, install the package, and fire
up your browser for you. You should be good to go!
